# Project Motivation:
Airbnb, Inc. is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking.Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Boston, MA. This project is the first project of data sciences Udacity's Nanodegree program. In this project, we will follow the CRISP-DM process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining). I  analyzed this dataset to find interesting outcomes and find interesting results. I asked and answered for these:

- The significant factors affect booking price.
- The most month attract the tourists.
- The most month have lower prices.
- The significant factors affect customer' reviews.

# File Descriptions:
To complete this project, you will use Jupyter Notebooks through a workspace in the classroom. Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to work with your code interactively while also being able to include descriptive and informative text to build a report. The next few concepts in this lesson will help you get started with understanding notebooks. If you would like to learn more about these tools, or you need some additional help to get started, you can check out Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks in the "[Intro to Data Analysis](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd025-mena-connect/parts/24b9c8f5-ef0f-4250-84d9-c5e8f843ed33)" Core Concept of this course.
